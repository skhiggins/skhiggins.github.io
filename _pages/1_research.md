Conditionally accepted, _American Economic Review_.
- <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Do coordination failures constrain financial technology adoption? Exploiting the Mexican government's rollout of one million debit cards to poor households from 2009--2012, I examine responses on both sides of the market, and find important spillovers and distributional impacts. On the supply side, small retail firms adopted point-of-sale terminals to accept card payments. On the demand side, this led to a 21% increase in other consumers' card adoption. The supply-side technology adoption response had positive effects on both richer consumers and small retail firms: richer consumers shifted 13% of their supermarket consumption to small retailers, whose sales and profits increased.</p></details>

- <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>We study an at-scale natural experiment in which debit cards were given to cash transfer recipients who already had a bank account. Using administrative account data and household surveys, we find that beneficiaries accumulated a savings stock equal to 2% of annual income after two years with the card. The increase in formal savings represents an increase in overall savings, financed by a reduction in current consumption. There are two mechanisms. First, debit cards reduce transaction costs of accessing money. Second, they reduce monitoring costs, which led beneficiaries to check their account balances frequently and build trust in the bank.</p></details>

- <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Debit cards reduce the travel distance to access bank accounts and can increase financial inclusion. We show that in Mexico, cash transfer beneficiaries who already received their transfers in bank accounts and subsequently received debit cards reduce their median distance to access the account from 4.8 to 1.3 kilometers. They also report being less likely to forgo important activities (childcare, work) to withdraw their transfers. Using account level data, we find a strong correlation between the reduction in travel distance and financial activity: beneficiaries facing the largest reductions in distance increase both their number of withdrawals and their savings balances.</p></details>

[Can a Poverty-Reducing and Progressive Tax and Transfer System Hurt the Poor?](/assets/pdf/HigginsLustig_JDE.pdf)
(with [Nora Lustig](https://www.noralustig.org/)). 
_Journal of Development Economics_ 122, 63-75, 2016.	
- <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>To analyze anti-poverty policies in tandem with the taxes used to pay for them, comparisons of poverty before and after taxes and transfers are often used. We show that these comparisons, as well as measures of horizontal equity and progressivity, can fail to capture an important aspect: that a substantial proportion of the poor are made poorer (or non-poor made poor) by the tax and transfer system. We illustrate with data from seventeen developing countries: in fifteen, the fiscal system is poverty-reducing and progressive, but in ten of these at least one-quarter of the poor pay more in taxes than they receive in transfers. We call this fiscal impoverishment, and axiomatically derive a measure of its extent. An analogous measure of fiscal gains of the poor is also derived, and we show that changes in the poverty gap can be decomposed into our axiomatic measures of fiscal impoverishment and gains.</p></details>

- <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Despite the importance of deposit financing for lending, banks in developing countries struggle to attract deposits. In a randomized experiment across 110 bank branches throughout Mexico, a lottery incentive based on net monthly deposits caused a 36% increase in the number of accounts opened and a 21% increase in the number of deposits during the lottery months. Nearly all new accounts (96%) were opened by households previously unbanked at any bank. The temporary two-month incentive had a persistent 2-3 year impact on the flow of deposits and stock of savings, and increased the present value of branch profits by 6%.</p></details>

- <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Despite the promise of FinTech lending to expand access to credit to populations without a formal credit history, FinTech lenders primarily lend to applicants with a formal credit history and rely on conventional credit bureau scores as an input to their algorithms. Using data from a large FinTech lender in Mexico, we show that alternative data from digital transactions through a delivery app are effective at predicting creditworthiness for borrowers with no credit history. We also show that segmenting our machine learning model by gender can improve credit allocation fairness without a substantive effect on the model's predictive performance.</p></details>

and [Santiago Truffa](https://santiagotruffa.cl/)). 
- <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>How do inaccurate priors about the distribution of interest rates affect search and outcomes in consumer credit markets? Consumer credit markets feature large amounts of within-borrower price dispersion in interest rates; if consumers are unaware of the extent of this price dispersion, they may shop less and take out loans at higher interest rates than they would otherwise. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 112,063 loan seekers in Chile where we we showed treated participants a price comparison tool that we built using administrative data from Chile's financial regulator. The tool shows loan seekers a conditional distribution of interest rates based on similar loans obtained recently by similar borrowers, using data on the universe of consumer loans merged with borrower characteristics. We also cross-randomized whether we asked participants their priors about the distribution of interest rates. We find that consumers thought interest rates were lower than they actually were, and the price comparison tool caused them to increase their expectations about the interest rate they would obtain by 56%. Consumers also underestimated price dispersion, and our price comparison tool caused them to increase their estimates of dispersion by 69%. The price comparison tool did not cause people to search or apply at more institutions, but it did cause them to receive 13% more offers and 11% lower interest rates, and to be 28% more likely to negotiate with their lender and 5% more likely to take out a loan. In contrast, merely asking participants their expectations about interest rates led them to search at 4% more institutions and obtain 9% lower interest rates.</p></details>

[Why Small Firms Fail to Adopt Profitable Opportunities](/assets/pdf/SmallFirmsProfitableOpportunities.pdf)
(with [Paul Gertler](https://www.paulgertler.com/), [Ulrike Malmendier](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~ulrike/), and [Waldo Ojeda](https://waldotekampa.me/)). 
- <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Why do small firms often fail to adopt new profitable opportunities? We explore a setting in which standard economic frictions are removed but many firms still do not adopt a profitable opportunity, and study three other frictions: limited memory, present bias, and a lack of trust in other firms. In partnership with a financial technology (FinTech) payments company in Mexico, we randomly offer 33,978 firms that are already users of the payment technology the opportunity to be charged a lower merchant fee for each payment they receive from customers. The median value of the fee reduction is 3% of total firm profits. We randomly vary the size of the fee reduction, a deadline, a reminder, and advance notice of the reminder. A deadline does not affect take-up for the larger firms in our sample, which implies limited or no present bias for these firms, while a deadline does increase take-up by 8% for smaller firms. Reminders increase take-up by 15%, and announced reminders by an additional 7%. Survey data help identify trust as the likely underlying mechanism behind the larger effect of the announced reminder: receiving an announced reminder increases firms' perceptions of the offer's value, and its treatment effect on take-up is stronger among firms that generally distrust advertised offers.</p></details>

[Towards a Cashless Economy? Evidence from the Elasticity of Cash Deposits of Mexican Firms](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mywbxewzwrzdntq/Tax_on_Cash_deposits_Draft.pdf?raw=1) (with [Pierre Bachas](https://pierrebachas.weebly.com/) and [Anders Jensen](https://www.andersditlevjensen.com/)). 
- <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>The transition from cash to traceable transaction technologies promises to reduce tax evasion and illegal flows. Should governments actively encourage this transition by making cash more costly to use? We study a policy in Mexico which sought to limit cash usage by taxing the flow of new cash deposited into bank accounts. Using the tax exemption threshold and firm level bank account data, we create variation in exposure to the tax based on firms' pre-tax intensity of cash reliance. We find that the flow of cash deposits is highly elastic to the tax rate: a 1% tax leads to a 60% reduction in cash deposits. This drop in cash deposits arises principally from a reduction in total bank deposits rather than substitution towards other transaction technologies. Thus policies which impact the cost of cash through banks have large efficiency costs and appear ineffective at accelerating the adoption of digital payments.</p></details>
